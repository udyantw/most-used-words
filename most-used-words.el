;;; Commentary:
;; Identify the most frequently used words in a buffer.
;;
;; The command
;;   M-x most-used-words-buffer
;; goes through the current buffer keeping a count of words, as defined
;; by the default syntax table.  Once done, it displays a buffer of the
;; most frequently used words.
;;
;; I wrote the following functions, and the wonderful posters at
;; gnu.emacs.help reviewed it.
;; Part of a discussion thread on gnu.emacs.help follows the
;; development:
;; https://groups.google.com/d/topic/gnu.emacs.help/nC8IsIuNeek/discussion
;;
;; Special thanks are due to Stefan Monnier and Eric Abrahamsen, who
;; made suggestions that greatly improved performance; Emmanuel Berg
;; reminded me to prefix functions from CL-LIB; Bob Proulx,
;; Ben Bacarisse, Nick Dokos, Eli Zaretskii shared of their Unix wisdom
;; and experience; and Bob Newell tested it for his purposes.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)

(defun most-used-words-buffer-1 (n)
  "Make a list of the N most used words in buffer."
  (let ((counts (make-hash-table :test #'equal))
	sorted-counts
	start
	end)
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (skip-syntax-forward "^w")
      (setf start (point))
      (cl-loop until (eobp)
	 do
	   (skip-syntax-forward "w")
	   (setf end (point))
	   (cl-incf (gethash (buffer-substring start end) counts 0))
	   (skip-syntax-forward "^w")
	   (setf start (point))))
    (cl-loop for word being the hash-keys of counts
       using (hash-values count)
       do
